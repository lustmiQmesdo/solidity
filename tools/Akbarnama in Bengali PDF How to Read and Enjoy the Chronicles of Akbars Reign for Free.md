The book is considered one of the most important sources of Mughal history and culture. It provides a detailed and vivid picture of Akbar's personality, his court, his empire, and his times. It also reflects Abu'l-Fazl's admiration and loyalty to Akbar, as well as his own views on religion, politics, and ethics.
 
Akbarnama was originally written in Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. It was later translated into several languages, including Bengali. The first Bengali translation was done by Jadunath Sarkar in 1908. He translated only the first volume of the book, which he published as *Akbarnama: The Book of Akbar*. He also wrote an introduction and notes to explain the historical and cultural context of the book.
 
The Bengali translation of Akbarnama is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about Akbar and his era. It is also a literary masterpiece that showcases the richness and beauty of the Bengali language. The book is available online for free download in PDF format from various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

Some of the major achievements of Akbar are:
 
- He expanded his empire to cover most of northern and central India, as well as parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. He defeated the Afghan rebels, the Rajput confederacy, the Sur dynasty, and the Bengal sultanate. He also annexed Gujarat, Malwa, Kashmir, Sind, Kandahar, and Orissa to his domains. [^1^] [^2^]
- He established a centralized administration based on the mansabdari system, in which officials were assigned ranks (mansabs) according to their status and responsibilities. The mansabdars were paid salaries in cash or land grants (jagirs), and were required to maintain a certain number of troops and horses. The mansabdari system ensured loyalty and efficiency among the officials, and also facilitated the mobilization of resources for war. [^1^] [^2^]
- He reformed the revenue system by introducing a uniform land tax (zabt) based on the measurement and classification of land. The tax was collected by state officials (amils) instead of local chieftains or zamindars. The zabt system increased the revenue of the state and reduced corruption and oppression of the peasants. [^1^] [^2^]
- He adopted a policy of religious tolerance and abolished the jizya (poll tax) on non-Muslims. He also encouraged inter-religious dialogue and debate through his institution of the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) at Fatehpur Sikri. He invited scholars and leaders of various faiths, such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam, to discuss their doctrines and beliefs before him. He also founded his own syncretic religion, called Din-i-Ilahi (Divine Faith), which incorporated elements from different religions. [^1^] [^2^]
- He fostered a rich and diverse culture that blended Persian, Indian, and Islamic influences. He patronized poets, painters, musicians, architects, historians, scientists, and scholars at his court. He commissioned many works of literature, such as the Akbarnama (History of Akbar), the Ain-i-Akbari (Constitution of Akbar), and the Tarikh-i-Alfi (History of a Thousand Years). He also supported the translation of many Sanskrit texts into Persian, such as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Atharvaveda. He built many magnificent buildings and monuments, such as the Agra Fort, the Fatehpur Sikri complex, the Buland Darwaza (Gate of Victory), and his own mausoleum at Sikandra. He also promoted various forms of art, such as miniature painting, calligraphy, music, dance, and drama. [^1^] [^2^]

Akbar was undoubtedly one of the greatest rulers in Indian history. He left behind a legacy of political unity, cultural diversity, religious tolerance, and artistic excellence that influenced generations to come.
