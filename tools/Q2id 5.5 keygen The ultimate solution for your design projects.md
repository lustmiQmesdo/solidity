- Before converting your QuarkXPress document, make sure you have all the fonts and images used in the document installed or available on your computer. If Q2ID cannot find a font or an image, it will replace it with a default font or a placeholder image.
- After converting your QuarkXPress document, check the text flow and alignment in the new InDesign document. Due to the differences between the text engines of QuarkXPress and InDesign, some text might wrap differently or overflow from the text boxes. You might need to adjust the text size, spacing, or hyphenation settings to fix these issues.
- After converting your QuarkXPress document, check the color models and profiles in the new InDesign document. Q2ID tries to preserve the color models (RGB, CMYK, etc.) and profiles (sRGB, Adobe RGB, etc.) of the original document, but sometimes they might change due to the differences between QuarkXPress and InDesign. You might need to change the color settings or assign different profiles to ensure consistent color output.
- If you want to convert multiple QuarkXPress documents at once, you can use the Batch Conversion feature of Q2ID. To do this, go to the Markzware menu and choose Batch Convert QuarkXPress... Then select the folder that contains the QuarkXPress documents that you want to convert and click OK. Q2ID will convert all the documents in the folder and save them in a new folder with the same name as the original folder.
