WWE Wrestlemania 27 was a historic event that showcased some of the best talent and entertainment that WWE has to offer. Here are some of the highlights of the PPV:

- The Undertaker vs Triple H: This was a brutal and emotional match that tested the limits of both men. The Undertaker put his legendary streak of 18-0 on the line against Triple H, who wanted to end it once and for all. The match had a special guest referee: Shawn Michaels, who had lost to The Undertaker twice at Wrestlemania. The match ended with The Undertaker barely surviving and extending his streak to 19-0, but at a great cost.[^3^]
- The Rock vs John Cena: This was the main event of Wrestlemania 27 and the culmination of a year-long feud between two of the biggest stars in WWE history. The Rock had returned to WWE after seven years to host Wrestlemania 27, but he also had a personal issue with John Cena, who had criticized him for leaving WWE for Hollywood. The match was a back-and-forth battle that saw both men give their best. The Rock emerged victorious after hitting Cena with a Rock Bottom, but he also showed respect to Cena after the match.[^4^]
- Edge vs Alberto Del Rio: This was Edge's last match in WWE before he retired due to a neck injury. He defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Alberto Del Rio, who had won the Royal Rumble match earlier that year. Edge managed to retain his title by spearing Del Rio and making him tap out to a crossface. Edge celebrated with his longtime friend Christian, who helped him fend off Del Rio's attack after the match.[^5^]
