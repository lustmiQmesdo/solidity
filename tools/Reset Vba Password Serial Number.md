# How to Reset VBA Password in Excel Files
 
VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is a programming language that allows you to create macros and automate tasks in Excel and other Microsoft Office applications. However, sometimes you may forget or lose the password that protects your VBA project from unauthorized access or modification. In this article, we will show you some methods to reset VBA password in Excel files using hex editor, direct VBA approach, or third-party software.

## Method 1: Using Hex Editor
 
A hex editor is a tool that allows you to view and edit the binary data of a file. You can use a hex editor to modify the VBA project file and remove the password protection. Here are the steps:
 
1. Make a backup copy of your Excel file that contains the locked VBA project.
2. Download and install a hex editor, such as Hex Edit (http://www.hexedit.com/).
3. Open your Excel file with the hex editor.
4. Search for the string "DPB" and replace it with "DPx".
5. Save the file and close the hex editor.
6. Open the Excel file with Excel. You may get a message box saying that there is an error in the file. Click "Yes" to continue.
7. Open the VBA editor (Alt+F11) and set a new password for your VBA project from the Project Properties dialog box.
8. Save and close the Excel file.

## Method 2: Using Direct VBA Approach
 
This method uses a VBA code that swaps the memory of the original function used to display the password dialog box with a user-defined function that always returns 1, which means the password is correct. Here are the steps:

1. Make a backup copy of your Excel file that contains the locked VBA project.
2. Create a new Excel file and insert a new module in the VBA editor.
3. Copy and paste the following code in the module, which is credited to Siwtom, a Vietnamese developer[^1^].
