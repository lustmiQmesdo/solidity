## Solution 1: Install Microsoft's update for D3DCompiler
 
If you are getting the D3DCOMPILER\_47.dll error, you need to install Microsoft's update for the D3DCompiler component on Windows. This update will provide the missing DLL file and allow Photoshop CC to launch. To install the update, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4019990/update-for-the-d3dcompiler-47-dll-component-on-windows) and download the appropriate update for your version of Windows.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install the update.
3. Restart your computer and launch Photoshop CC to check if the error is resolved.

## Solution 2: Roll back to an earlier version of Camera Raw
 
If you are getting the api-ms-win-core-synch-l1-1-0.dll error, you need to roll back to an earlier version of Camera Raw that is compatible with your version of Windows. The latest version of Camera Raw (13.4) requires Windows 10, so you need to install a previous version such as 12.2.1. To roll back to an earlier version of Camera Raw, follow these steps:

1. Go to [this link](https://helpx.adobe.com/camera-raw/kb/camera-raw-plug-in-installer.html) and download the Camera Raw 12.2.1 installer.
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install Camera Raw 12.2.1.
3. Launch Photoshop CC to check if the error is resolved.

Note: Make sure to turn off auto-update in your Creative Cloud app so it doesn't overwrite Camera Raw 12.2.1 with a newer version.

## FAQs
 
Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about Adobe Photoshop CC DLL 19 errors on Windows:
 
### What is a DLL file?
 
A DLL file is a dynamic link library file that contains code and data that can be used by multiple programs. DLL files allow programs to share functionality and reduce the size of the executable files. However, if a DLL file is missing or corrupted, it can cause errors and prevent programs from running.
 
### Why do I need to update D3DCompiler?
 
D3DCompiler is a component that provides DirectX functionality for graphics and gaming applications. Photoshop CC uses D3DCompiler to render images and effects. If you are using Windows 7 or 8.1, you may not have the latest version of D3DCompiler installed, which can cause the D3DCOMPILER\_47.dll error. By installing Microsoft's update for D3DCompiler, you can fix this error and improve the performance of Photoshop CC.
 
### Why do I need to roll back Camera Raw?
 
Camera Raw is a plug-in that allows Photoshop CC to import and edit raw images from digital cameras. Camera Raw is updated regularly to support new camera models and features. However, the latest version of Camera Raw (13.4) requires Windows 10 to run, which can cause the api-ms-win-core-synch-l1-1-0.dll error if you are using Windows 7 or 8.1. By rolling back to an earlier version of Camera Raw (12.2.1), you can fix this error and still use Camera Raw with Photoshop CC.
