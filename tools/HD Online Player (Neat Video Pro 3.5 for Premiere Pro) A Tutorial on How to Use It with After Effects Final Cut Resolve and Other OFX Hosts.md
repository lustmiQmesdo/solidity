## Step 1: Download and Install Neat Video Pro 3.5 for Premiere Pro
 
You can download Neat Video Pro 3.5 for Premiere Pro from the official website[^1^] or from other online sources[^2^]. The installation process is straightforward and you just need to follow the instructions on the screen. After installing the plug-in, you need to restart Premiere Pro to activate it.
 
## Step 2: Apply Neat Video Pro 3.5 to Your Video Clip
 
To apply Neat Video Pro 3.5 to your video clip, you need to drag and drop it from the Effects panel to the clip on the timeline. Alternatively, you can right-click on the clip and choose Video Effects > Neat Video > Reduce Noise v3.

## Step 3: Build a Noise Profile
 
The first thing you need to do in Neat Video is to build a noise profile for your video clip. A noise profile is a set of parameters that describe the characteristics of the noise in your clip. Neat Video uses this information to filter out the noise and preserve the details.
 
To build a noise profile, you need to select a frame from your clip that contains a flat area of uniform color and brightness. This area should be large enough to cover at least half of the preview window. You can use the Auto Profile button to let Neat Video find such an area automatically, or you can use the Select Area tool to draw a rectangle around it manually.
